What I learned from this demo:

* Build a basic interface with Button/Label/NavigationBar/BarButtomItem
* AutoLayout basics: Stack View and Constrains
* The keywords: @IBOutlet/@IBAction/weak
* I now upload the projects to Github via git on my Macbook

**What inspires me is the project: [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/)**
